As well as providing you with regular data insights such as traffic or site speed, Swetrix also offers client-side error tracking.
This allows you to track when, on which pages and what kind of errors your users are experiencing. The error tracking script is included in swetrix.js by default and can be easily enabled with a [one line of code](/swetrix-js-reference#trackerrors).

Error tracking is included in all plans and is charged as 1 error event = 1 regular event (like a pageview or custom event).
