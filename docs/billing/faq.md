## How does billing work?

## Will I be billed per account or per website?
TLDR: We charge per account.

Our subscription tiers are based on the total number of page views, custom events (and other events such as CAPTCHA) of all the projects you create on our account, so you can add as many sites to Swetrix as you like, the total number of events across all of them will count as your total number of events towards your subscription tier.

All our subscription plans include up to 50 projects for free, for each additional project you will be charged $0.15 per project.

## How do I access my invoices?
We use Paddle as our payment processor, which sends invoices by email, with a copy in the body of the email and a link to view the invoice on a hosted website.

## Can I switch between monthly and yearly billing?
You can switch between monthly and annual billing at any time. For example, if you are halfway through your annual subscription and decide to switch to a monthly subscription, the price will be prorated to reflect what you have already paid.

## What payment methods does Swetrix accept?
We accept credit/debit cards, PayPal, Google Pay and Apple Pay. All payments are processed securely through Paddle.
