To cancel your subscription plan, log into your account and go to the [Billing](https://swetrix.com/billing) page. To cancel your subscription, click on the "Cancel subscription" button located next to the tier selector.

After cancelling, you will still have access to your dashboard and statistics will continue to be collected until the end of your current subscription cycle.
