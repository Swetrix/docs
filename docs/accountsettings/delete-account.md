To delete your Swetrix account, you need to log in to your account and go to the [account settings page](https://swetrix.com/user-settings).

Make sure you unsubscribed from the paid subscription if you have one. You can do this on the [billing page](https://swetrix.com/billing).

Click on the "Account" tab and then down to the end of the page. There you will see the "Delete account" button that will allow you to delete your account.

:::caution
Deleting your account will delete all your data permanently and you will not be able to recover it.
