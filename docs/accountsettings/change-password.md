## How to change your password

To change your password, you need to log in to your account and go to the [account settings page](https://swetrix.com/user-settings).

On the "Account" tab, you will see the "General settings" section. Click on the "Change password" button and a form to change your password will appear.

When you enter your new password, click on the "Update profile" button. This will log you out of all your devices and you will need to log in again with your new password.
