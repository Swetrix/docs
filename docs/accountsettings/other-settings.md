## How to link Google / Github accounts with your Swetrix account

Socialisation feature allows you to link 3rd party accounts (like Google or Github) to your Swetrix account and use them to sign in to Swetrix.

To do this, go to your [account settings](https://swetrix.com/user-settings) and open the Account tab. Scroll down to the Socialisations section, and click on the Link button for the service you want to connect.

A popup window will be opened prompting you to log into the account you want to connect.

After you connect it, you will be able to login to Swetrix using this account. You can also unlink it at any time.

:::note
Please note that if you used Google or Github SSO feature to create an account, you will not be able to unlink it.
