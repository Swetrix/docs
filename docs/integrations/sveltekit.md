After you sign up on Swetrix and create a new project, the only thing left is to add it to your website.

## Installation
1. Install the Swetrix package via `npm install swetrix`.
2. Go to your SvelteKit website codebase and either create a new `+layout.svelte` file or use an existing one.
3. Make your layout file look like this:
```html
<script>
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  import { browser, dev } from '$app/environment';
  import { page } from "$app/stores";
  import * as Swetrix from "swetrix";

  onMount(() => {
    Swetrix.init("YOUR_PROJECT_ID", { devMode: dev, disabled: dev });
    Swetrix.trackViews();
  });

  // Trigger a pageview everytime the user navigates.
  // We use the `browser` env variable to ensure that we don't try to 
  // call trackViews while the component is doing SSR.
  $: $page.url.pathname, browser && Swetrix.trackViews();
</script>

<!-- Your site's content gets injected here -->
<slot />
```

:::caution
It's very important not to forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID you can find in the Dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work!
:::

## Check your installation
After installing Swetrix tracking script, go to your website and visit some pages.

Within a minute you should be able to see new pageviews being added to your project's dahsboard.
