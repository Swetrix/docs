After you sign up on Swetrix and create a new project, the only thing left is to add it to your website.

## Installation

1. Log in to your Webflow account.
2. Open up your project, go to the `Project Settings > Custom Code` section:
   <img alt="Webflow screenshot" src={useBaseUrl('img/webflow-int.png')} />

3. In the `Head code` section you need to add the following:

```html
<script src="https://swetrix.org/swetrix.js" defer></script>
```

4. In the `Footer code` section you need to add the following:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    swetrix.init('YOUR_PROJECT_ID')
    swetrix.trackViews()
  })
</script>

<noscript>
  <img
    src="https://api.swetrix.com/log/noscript?pid=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    alt=""
    referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
  />
</noscript>
```

:::caution
It's very important not to forget to replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Project ID you can find in the Dashboard, otherwise tracking won't work!

## Check your installation

After installing Swetrix tracking script, go to your website and visit some pages.

Within a minute you should be able to see new pageviews being added to your project's dahsboard.
