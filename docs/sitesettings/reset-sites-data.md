import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

On your [site settings](/how-to-access-site-settings) page, you can reset your site's data. This will delete all analytics data, but keep your settings and site ID intact.

:::caution
This action is irreversible. Once you reset your site's data, all analytics data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
:::

To reset your site's data, click on the "Reset project" button:

<img alt="Invite user" src={useBaseUrl('img/sitesettings/reset_settings.png')} />

In the confirmation dialog, you will find 3 options:
1. **Reset all**: This will permanently delete all analytics data for all time, but the site ID and it's settings will remain intact.
2. **Reset partially**: Partial reset allows you to delete data for a specific time range.
3. **Reset via filters**: This allows you to delete data based on specific filters (e.g. delete all data for a specific referrer, country, etc.).
