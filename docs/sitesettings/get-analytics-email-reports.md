### How to remove users from the email reports
Under the "Email reports" section you can see the list of recipients. If a recipient did not accept the invitation, you can remove them from the list by clicking on the "Remove" button.

If they accepted the invitation, you can remove them from the list by clicking on the reports frequency button and in the dropdown menu click on "Remove member".
