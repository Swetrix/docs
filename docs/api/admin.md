Swetrix provides the ability to control your projects (and soon your account) via an API as well.

Each request must be authenticated with an API key using `X-Api-Key` HTTP header. You can obtain an API key in your Swetrix [account settings](https://swetrix.com/user-settings).

Rate limit for the API depends on your plan, you can find more information on the billing (or the main) page.
As of 9 February 2023, the rate limits are as follows:
- **Free plan**: 600 requests per hour;
- **Any paid plan**: 600 requests per hour.

If you have special needs for more requests, please [contact us](https://swetrix.com/contact) to request more capacity.

## Concepts
### Projects manipulation
#### 'Create project' / 'Update project' payload
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | `true` | A display name for your project, max length is 50 chars. |
| `isCaptcha` | `boolean` | `false` | (Only supported when creating a new project). Set to `true` if your project is a [CAPTCHA](/captcha/introduction) project. `false` by default. |
| `public` | `boolean` | `false` | Set to `true` if your project should have a publicly available dashboard. `false` by default. |
| `isPasswordProtected` | `boolean` | `false` | Set to `true` if your project's dashboard should be password protected. `false` by default. |
| `password` | `string` | `false` | Required only if `isPasswordProtected` is set to `true`. That is the password unauthorised people will have to enter to access your project's dashboard. |
| `origins` | `Array<string>` | `false` | An array of origins (domains) which are allowed to use script with your ProjectID. For example: `['cornell.edu', 'app.example.com', '*.gov.ua']`. By default all origins are allowed. |
| `ipBlacklist` | `Array<string>` | `false` | An aeeay of IP addresses from which no analytics will be collected on this project. This functionality is handy if you want to ignore analytics from your IP. For example: `['172.126.10.16', '192.168.0.1/32', '::1']` |
