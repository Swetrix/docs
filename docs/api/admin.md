Swetrix provides the ability to control your projects (and soon your account) via an API as well.

Each request must be authenticated with an API key using `X-Api-Key` HTTP header. You can obtain an API key in your Swetrix [account settings](https://swetrix.com/settings).

Rate limit for the API depends on your plan, you can find more information on the billing (or the main) page.
As of 9 February 2023, the rate limits are as follows:

- **Free plan**: 600 requests per hour;
- **Any paid plan**: 600 requests per hour.

If you have special needs for more requests, please [contact us](https://swetrix.com/contact) to request more capacity.

| `name`                | `string`  | `true`   | A display name for your project, max length is 50 chars.                                                                                                 |
| `isCaptcha`           | `boolean` | `false`  | (Only supported when creating a new project). Set to `true` if your project is a [CAPTCHA](/captcha/introduction) project. `false` by default.           |
